### AI Financial Coach Agent

The AI Financial Coach Agent is a web-based application powered by Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Streamlit, designed to provide personalized financial advice.

* Automated categorization and spending pattern analysis.
* Interactive visualizations (pie charts, bar graphs) using Plotly.
